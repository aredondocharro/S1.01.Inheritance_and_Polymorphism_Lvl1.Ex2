# 🎻 Musical Instruments System

## 📄 Description - Exercise Statement

In a music group there are different types of musical instruments. There are wind, string, and percussion instruments.

All instruments have as attributes their name and price. Additionally, they have a method called play(). This is abstract in the Instrument class and therefore must be implemented in the child classes. When playing:
- A wind instrument should display: "A wind instrument is playing"
- A string instrument: "A string instrument is playing"
- A percussion instrument: "A percussion instrument is playing"

The class loading process only occurs once. Demonstrate that loading can be triggered either by:
1. Creating the first instance of the class
2. Accessing a static member of the class

Research Java's initialization blocks and static blocks.
