# 🚗 Car Class Demonstration

## 📄 Description - Exercise Statement

Create a class "Car" with the attributes: make, model, and horsepower. The make must be final static, the model static, and the horsepower final. Demonstrate the difference between the three. Are there any that can be initialized in the class constructor?

Add two methods to the class "Car". A static method called brake() and a non-static method called accelerate(). The accelerate method should output to the console: “The vehicle is accelerating” and the brake() method should output: “The vehicle is braking”.

Demonstrate how to invoke the static and non-static methods from the main() of the main class.
